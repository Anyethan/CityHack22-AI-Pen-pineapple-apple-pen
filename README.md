# Description
The food delivery industry in HK is not mature enough. Based on the investigation, we found 2 existing problems: The long waiting time for customers and
Our system can predict customer demand based on time series. Thus, it can help delivery companies improve efficiency by predicting user demand for delivery items at different times of the day. 
 
The team has attempted multiple models and finally choose the Deep Learning AI model with bi-LSTM as the main layers of model to predict the demand. With previous date and other related data as training inputs, the model can be generated and predict the future demand based on some known data precisely.

# Technique
### 1.Feature Engineering
Handle the data with date 
### 2. Deep Learning biLSTM model
Use multiple biLSTM layers as the main component of DL model
### 3.Data Mining
Use SAS Enterprise miner and python for the first stage data mining
